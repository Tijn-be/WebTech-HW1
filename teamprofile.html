        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of 2004, Jaguar Grand Prix was sold to Red Bull.
          Following poor financial results from parent company Ford, management decided to cut many thousands of jobs worldwide.
          According to that same management, it could not be justified that thousands of employees were losing their jobs while hundreds of millions of dollars continued to be pumped into the unsuccessful F1 project.
        </p>

        <p>
          In its first year of existence, the team still raced with a Cosworth engine, even though Cosworth had also been sold by Ford.
          During the 2005 season, Red Bull Racing employed four drivers.
          The lead driver was David Coulthard, who had joined from McLaren.
          For the second seat, Christian Klien and Vitantonio Liuzzi alternated.
          Additionally, American GP2 driver Scott Speed took on the role of Friday and reserve driver at several Formula 1 Grand Prix events.

        <h2>Red Bull Ring</h2>
        <img src="/Images/RedBullRing.png" height="200px">
          <h4>The Era of Glory (1970 - 1987)</h4>
          <p>
          The circuit was built in 1969 and opened on July 26 of that year, featuring a length of approximately six kilometers.
          Under this configuration, it remained on the Formula 1 calendar as the Österreichring until 1987.
          The track was renowned as a high-speed circuit; however, two major incidents at the start of the 1987 race caused significant damage.
          Consequently, the circuit was deemed too dangerous and was removed from the Formula 1 World Championship calendar for ten years.
          </p>

          <h4>The Rebirth (1997 - 2003)</h4>
          <p>
          Following extensive political debate, the circuit was shortened to 4,318 meters in 1995 and outfitted with improved safety measures.
          This project was handled by Formula 1 track designer Hermann Tilke.
          As a result, the Austrian Grand Prix returned from 1997 through 2003.
          At this time, it was decided to link the name of the main sponsor to the new circuit.
          The sponsor was the Austrian telecom company A1 (Mobilkom Austria), leading to the name A1 Ring.
          </p>

          <p>
          After 2003, the Grand Prix disappeared from the calendar once again.
          Officially, the race was cancelled due to the EU ban on tobacco advertising; unofficially, the event was generating too much of a financial loss to continue.
          </p>

          <h4>The Third Renewal (2005 - Present)</h4>
          <p>
          Dietrich Mateschitz purchased the circuit with his company, Red Bull, in 2005. Alongside three major investors (KTM, Magna International, and Volkswagen), he had grand plans for the track.
          However, these plans failed due to protests from local residents and the withdrawal of one of the financiers.
          </p>

          <p>
          Because demolition had already begun during the design phase, the circuit was left unusable for racing, and its future looked bleak.
          The outlook changed unexpectedly on April 3, 2008, when the Kleine Zeitung ran a front-page story announcing that a scaled-down renovation could proceed.
          The Red Bull Ring officially reopened on May 15, 2011, hosting a DTM race shortly after on June 5.
          Formula 1 returned to the renovated track in 2014, followed by the return of MotoGP in 2016.
