        <h3>Current Car: RB21 Ultron 67 Edition</h3>
        <p>
          The RB21 Ultron 67 Edition is basically a rocket without wheels.
          Yes you heard that right, this car has no wheels. What does that say about the definition of a car?
          Well don't ask us, we are Red Bull Racing, not philosophers. We just made it work.
          It was designed to go unbelievably fast and make other teams question
          their life decisions into the first 5 seconds of the race. This thing needs its own timezone.

        <h3>Previous Cars</h3>
        <p>
          Every year they say "this can't get better" and then somehow it does.

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>RB20 (2025)</b> This beaut won races as if it was made for it. Technically, it was, but still. It was so good that other teams considered hiring a magician to figure out its secrets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>RB19 (2024)</b> This thing was so aerodynamic it created a it invented a second sonic boom every time it went around a corner
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>RB18 (2023)</b> Introduced "Mega Floor 2.0."
            This thing has so much surface area, it could probably double as a solar panel. It was basically a flying carpet with wings.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>RB17 (2022)</b> We actually didn't win any races with it since it was so fast it wasn't allowed to compete.

        <h3>Technical Overview</h3>
        <p>
          A Formula 1 car is basically a very expensive science experiment
          with wings. Everything exists for one reason: go brrrr.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Aerodynamics:</b> Wings + floor + diffuser make the car stick
            to the ground like glue. Great downforce or whatever, it just works.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Power Unit:</b> Engine + hybrid system = speed and brrrr sounds.
            Mostly cool noises. Can't forget about the fairy dust emulsifier, which is the secret sauce that makes our cars go faster than the speed of light. It's like a magic potion, but for cars.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Suspension:</b> Keeps the car stable while the driver is
            doing 300 km/h around corners. It's the cars way of giving the driver a smooth ride while going at speeds that a rocket ship would be lowkey jealous of.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tyres:</b> Soft, Medium, Hard, or none at all, depending on the vibe of the race and how much we want to mess with the other teams. We like to keep them guessing.
          </li>
        </ul>
